This visualization presents a comprehensive comparison of motivations, searched information and success rate of shopping activities of Internet users in 1997. The visualization displays each of the mentioned topics in the context of a narrative that explains the shopping behaviour of Internet users in 1997. Each of the stages is made of two diagrams; one shows an overview of how distributed answers are among all users that participated in the survey in a form of treemap. The second one shows what concepts were more important to the users compared with the rest using horizontal bars. In chapter Results we analyse the main findings this visualization helps to discover from the data.
